TESTwebsite
Hello,
This TestWebsite is just me trying to figure out how to upload my site on GitHub.
The site is (as you can see in the code) Just some basic stuff like a heading, text and an image with some css.
If this site works then the site i want to upload will probably follow shortly after.

Help or just tips/ tricks are always welcome U can also (all of this only if you want ofcourse (Duh...)) 
Send me pieces of html/css/Javascript code that are just awesome/fun i'd love to learn more about it. 
I'm really just beginning in IT so keep that in mind if u message me i might not understand everything 
but i'll probably find it on google/w3schools.

Thank you for reading this.
And have a nice day. :D

AlexanderVdd
